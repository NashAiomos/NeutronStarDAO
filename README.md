# NeutronStarBlog social platform.
### Open source web3.0 social platform on IC!
## Basic functions.
People can log in as ii, comment, message, comment, favorite articles, write markdown articles, and then publish them.

## Posting articles.
When posting an article, you can choose to post it as an NFT, and later you can sell this NFT (sell the article).
It is up to the author to decide whether to post a regular article or an NFT article. Ordinary articles cannot be sold.
Under the article there is a point like, reward, comment, collection function.

In order to prevent authors from posting low-quality NFT articles, authors need to spend some token to publish NFT blogs, viewers can get a little token after reading the article, and participate in the comments can also. token is limited, until the end of the distribution.

## View article.
When the article is not hot and not many views, each viewer can get more token. When the article becomes hot and more people read it, people get less and less token. It's like the reward of bitcoin mining. Each user can write many comments, but get fewer and fewer tokens, and if a few of them have a particularly high number of likes, they can get a little extra reward.

Because the reward token for simply viewing or liking an article is so small, users need to collect a certain number of tokens before they can mention them to their wallet.

## Answer the question.
The token the author turns in is what helps his or her NFT become hot at the beginning of the article's release. The author can leave some questions about the article at the end of their article, people read the article and answer these questions, the answers are submitted to the author, the author can also get a little token reward after reviewing and approving the article, this reward is much more than the reward for viewing and commenting on the article.

## Price of NFT.
The more likes the article has read, the higher the ranking in the community BlogSteam, the easier it is for others to see, which means the faster the author's token is consumed, indicating that the article is of good quality. The more expensive this NFT, the author can only choose to make the article NFT or not to do NFT, not to do not spend money well. Doing NFT shows that the author has confidence in his work. The author cannot set a price, the price of NFT is determined by the number of reads, likes, comments and favorites.

Authors can only decide to sell their NFT articles, or not, but the price of NFT is public information that has been marked on the article.

## Front-end and back-end independent.
The blog is divided into a front-end page system and a back-end jar system.
User articles are stored in their own jars, and any front-end page access to user data requires user authorization of which jars can and cannot be accessed.

I think these articles made into NFT are the crystallization of human wisdom, these good articles are like books, is valuable, books have copyright protection, in the web3 world, NFT can give the article copyright more imagination. Various good blogs are the essence, the essence should be collected, the essence is rare.

Authors can also initiate auction requests, community votes, and put up for auction NFT articles that people agree are excellent.

People can publish their ideas, notes, thoughts: for example, a popular artist's diary, thoughts, feelings, ideas into a series of NFT, record his journey; comments bound to the article, the article is NFT can not change, but the article comments can always be added.

The content is a long article: somewhat similar to WeChat public articles, diaries, Little Red Book notes, Zhihu. Pictures and videos can be added to the articles.

In the web3 world, something belongs to the user, but others don't know, and want others to know or have to make NFT and publish it. It's a bit similar to applying for a copyright, applying for a patent for an invention.
So the key point is: selling NFT = selling patents.

Leave your opinion about NFT.
