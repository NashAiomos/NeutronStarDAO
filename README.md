# NeutronStarBlog social platform.
### The open source web3.0 social platform on IC!
## Basic functions.
People can log in, comment, message, comment, favorite articles with ii identity, write markdown articles, and then publish them. Pictures and videos can be added to the article.

## Posting articles.
When posting an article, you can choose to post it as an NFT, and later you can sell this NFT (sell articles). It is up to the author to decide whether to post a normal article or an NFT article. Ordinary articles cannot be sold. Under the article there is a point like, reward, comment, collection function.

In order to prevent authors from posting low-quality NFT articles, authors need to spend some token to publish NFT blogs, the audience can get a little token after reading the article, and participate in the comments can also. token is limited, until the end of the distribution.

## Viewing articles.
When the article is not hot, not many views, each viewer can get more token. When the article becomes hot and more people read it, people get less and less token. It's like the reward of bitcoin mining. Each user can write many comments, but get fewer and fewer tokens, and if a few of them have a particularly high number of likes, they can get a little extra reward.

Because the reward token for simply browsing articles or liking articles is too small, users need to collect a certain number of tokens before they can put the token into their wallets. (This is much more conscientious than Poundland, it's true)

## Answer the question.
The token handed over by the author is what helps his or her NFT become hot at the beginning of the article's release. The author can leave some questions about the article at the end of his article, people read the article and answer these questions, the answers are submitted to the author, the author can also get a little token reward after review and approval, this reward is much more than the reward for viewing and commenting on the article.

## The price of NFT.
The more likes the article has read, the higher the ranking in Steam, the easier it is to be seen by others, which means the faster the author's token is consumed, indicating that the quality of the article is very good. The more expensive this NFT, the author can only choose to make the article NFT or do not do NFT, do not do not spend money well. Doing NFT shows that the author has confidence in his work. The author cannot set a price, the price of NFT is determined by the number of reads, likes, comments and favorites.

Authors can only decide to sell their NFT articles, or not, but the price of NFT is public information that has been marked on the article.

## Article content review.

I think these articles made into NFT are the crystallization of human wisdom, these good articles are like books, is valuable, books have copyright protection, in the web3 world, NFT can give articles copyright more imaginative. Various good blogs are the essence, the essence should be collected, the essence is rare.

Authors can also initiate auction requests, community votes, and put up for auction NFT articles that people agree are excellent.

People can publish their ideas, notes, thoughts: for example, a popular artist's diary, thoughts, feelings, ideas into a series of NFT, record his journey; comments bound to the article, the article is NFT can not change, but the article comments can always be added.

In the web3 world, things belong to the user, but others do not know, want to let others know or have to make NFT, and then published. It's a bit similar to applying for a copyright or a patent for an invention. So the key point is: selling NFT = selling patents.

Leave your opinion about NFT.
