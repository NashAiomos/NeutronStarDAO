# NeutronStarDAO

This is a blog platform made in the form of dao:.
Built on IC.
People can log in, comment, message, comment as ii, which is equivalent to discussing in a forum, and open the page directly to write markdown articles and publish them.

When publishing, you can choose to make an NFT of each article published and publish it, and later you can sell this NFT (sell the article).
The author can decide to post a regular article, or post an NFT article. Regular articles cannot be sold.
Under the article there is a point like, reward, comment, favorite function.

In order to prevent authors from posting low-quality NFT articles, authors need to spend some tokens to publish NFT blogs, users can get a little token after reading the article, and participate in the comments can also. token is limited, until the end of the distribution.
When the article is not hot, each viewer can get more tokens. When the article becomes hot, more and more people will read it, and people will get less and less token. It's like the reward for bitcoin mining. Each user can write many comments, but get less and less token, and if a few of them have a particularly high number of likes, they get a little extra reward.

The more likes the article reads, the higher the ranking in Steam, the easier it is to be seen by others, which means the faster the author's token is consumed, indicating that the article is of good quality. The more expensive this NFT, the author can only choose to make the article NFT or do not do NFT, do not do not spend money well. Do NFT means that the author has confidence in his work, the author can not set a price, the price of NFT is determined by the number of reads, likes, comments, collections. The author can of course choose to sell NFT, or not, but the price of NFT is public information that is always marked on the article.
Because I think these articles made into NFT are the crystallization of human wisdom, these good articles are like books, is valuable, books have copyright protection, in the web3 world, copyright is universal, NFT can give more imagination to copyright. A variety of good is blog is the essence, the essence should be collected, the essence is rare.
Authors can also initiate auction requests, community voting, and put the NFT articles that people agree are excellent up for auction.

People can publish their own ideas, notes, thoughts: for example, a popular artist's diary, thoughts, feelings, thoughts into a series of NFT, record his journey; I was thinking that if Van Gogh lived in the era of this NFT article would be able to record his own trajectory in the world. There would be no more rumors (because in addition to the articles there are also people's comments and likes). In other words, this NFT is dynamic, comments bound to the article, the article is NFT can not change, but the article are comments can always increase.

I think this idea is because web3 decentralized well, something to the user, to the user is to the user, but others do not know, want to let others know or have to make NFT, and then published.
It's a bit like applying for a copyright or a patent for an invention.
Selling NFT = Selling patents.
