When the back end is ready, you can let people directly open the page to write markdown articles and then publish them, and later you can also add ii identity to let others log in, comment, leave messages, discuss: equivalent to discussing in the forum.

then later: you can add the NFT function, you can choose to make each article published NFT release, you can sell this NFT (sell articles)
Let others log in with ii, you can also send articles, send NFT articles
Like, reward function.

In order to prevent authors from posting low quality articles, authors need to spend some token to publish NFTblog, and users can get a little token after reading the article. when the article is not hot, each viewer can get more token. when the article becomes hot, more and more people read it, people will get less and less token. It's like the reward for bitcoin mining.
The more likes the article gets read, the higher the ranking, the easier it is for others to see, which means the faster the author's token is consumed, which means the article is of good quality. The more expensive this NFT, the author can only choose to make the article NFT or do not do NFT, do not do not spend money well. Do NFT means that the author has confidence in his work, the author can not set a price, the price of NFT has the number of reads, likes, comments, collections decided. The author can of course choose to sell NFT, or not, but the price of NFT is public information that is always marked on the article.
Because I think these articles made into NFT are the crystallization of human wisdom, these good articles just like the book, is valuable. Book has copyright protection, in the web3 world, copyright is universal, NFT can give copyright more imagination. A variety of good is blog is the essence, the essence should be collected, the essence is rare.
Authors can also initiate auction requests, community voting, and put up for auction the NFT articles that people agree are excellent.

People can publish their own ideas, notes, thoughts: for example, a popular artist's diary, thoughts, feelings, thoughts into a series of NFT, record his journey; I was thinking that if Van Gogh lived in the era of this NFT article would be able to record his own trajectory in the world. There would be no more rumors (because in addition to the articles there are also people's comments, likes). In other words, this NFT is static, comments are bound to the article, the article is NFT can not change, but the article are comments can always increase.

I think this idea is because web3 decentralization well, something to the user, to the user is to the user, but others do not know. If you want to let others know, you have to make NFT, and then published.
It is somewhat similar to applying for a copyright, applied for a patent for an invention. 

Leave your views on NFT.
